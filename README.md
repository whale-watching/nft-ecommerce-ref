## ❗WARNING
This project is just an educational system, NOT a system made to carry out large transactions
and with the same focus as nft. I developed this system only with the intention of showing that 
I could even create an e-commerce (for example) accepting payments with cryptocurrencies outside the blockchain.

### 💸GdMoney
After finishing the backend api development module of my course, I decided to develop this
project as a course conclusion project, where I gathered my front-end and back-end knowledge
in a different proposal, the use of cryptocurrency payments by off the blockchain
